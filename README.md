# Module 2 Challenge | Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio
## Professional Portfolio
## Description
This is the completed application of the Module 2 challenge. The purpose of this challenge was to use the advanced CSS we learned to create a professional portfolio webpage. The portfolio contains my contact information, some information about me, and examples of my work. As I currently do not yet have any web applications, the work examples are currently placeholders. They will be replaced with any projects I develop throughout the progression of this course.
